The  people of the city lived a happy and \\ncontented life as they were ruled by a wonderful king called \\nDasharatha.  He cared for his people very deeply.  \\n \\nKing Dasahratha  had three wives, Kaushalya, Sumitra and Kaikeyi.  \\nKaushalya was the eldest queen.  Though the king loved all his wives  \\ndeeply, it  was Kaikeyi, his  youngest queen who was his favourite.But \\nin spite of leading such a good life . Dasahratha  was still an unhappy \\nman.This was because he had no children. He  was getting old and \\nhad no son to ascend to the throne.  \\n \\nUnable to see the king being sad, the sages advised him to \\nundertake a yagna and pray for children. Heeding  to their advice, he \\nperformed the yagna and pleased with him, Agni , the fire God, \\nemerged out of the fire pit, handed  over a cup containing sweetened \\nmilk to the king and told him \"O king! This  kheer is the nectar of life. \\nIt was prepared by the gods in heaven. Distribute  it among your \\nwives. You will be blessed with sons.\"  \\n \\nDasahratha  was delighted. He  thanked Agni for this boon and in the \\nroyal chamber, gave  Kaushalya half of the kheer. He  divided the \\nremaining kheer into two portions and gave one portion to Sumitra \\nand the other one to Kaikeyi.  \\n \\nSubsequently all the three queens gave birth to sons, Kaushalya  \\ngave birth to Rama,  after which Bharata was born to Kaikeyi  and \\nlater on Sumitra gave birth to Lakshmana and Shatrugna.King \\nDasahratha was very happy and so were the people of Ayodhya.With \\ngreat rejoice, they  celebrated the birth of the four princes.  \\n \\nDasharatha loved all his sons but Rama was his dearest.

Under  sage \\nVashistha\\'s guidance , they  excelled themselves in archery, riding  \\nand hunting. They  also learnt about the holy  books and how to look \\nafter the welfare of the people. They  respected their Gurus and the \\nelders and gained the love and affection of people of Ayodhya.  \\nThe brothers loved each other very much too. Lakshmana  was a very \\nclose companion to Rama.Bharatha and Shatrugna were the other \\ntwo inseparables . \\n \\nKing Dasharatha felt very proud of his  sons. One day he was \\ndiscussing with sage Vashishta about finding suitable brides for his \\nsons. At that time a great sage called Vishwamitra came to the court \\nof Dasharatha. The  king was very happy to welcome him Ayodhya. \\nAfter extending a warm hospitalit y he asked Vishwamitra \"O great \\nsage! Your visit has made me a very happy. Pray, tell  me the \\npurpose of your visit. I shall deem it a great honour to abide by your \\nwish.\"  \\n \\nVishwamitra, pleased with the king\\'s words told him \"King \\nDasharatha! I am pleased w ith your hospitality. I have heard that  \\nyou always keep up your word. That\\'s why I am here. I about to \\nperform  a yagna but two Rakshasas, Mareecha and Subahu , pour  \\nblood and human flesh on the fire pit and pollute the Yagna. I  cannot \\ncast any curse on them  as I am involved in sacred work. But I \\ncannot perform  the yagna till these demons are killed.Rama, your \\nson, is the only valiant  person who can kill them. Hence, please send \\nhim with me for ten days. As soon as the yagna is completed, I will \\nsend back Ram a to Ayodhya.\"  \\n \\nWhen aged king heard this request, he felt nervous about sending \\nhis young son to fight against the demons. “Respect  Sage\",  \\nHe pleaded with Vishwamitra, \"My dear son Rama is still very young. \\nHow can he fight against the Rakshass? Instead of Rama, I will send \\nmy entire army to help you in conducting yagna. I cannot bear to be \\nseparated  from Rama and hence please spare me this agony.\"  \\nVishwamitra was angry at Dasharatha\\'s words.\"O king, you are \\ngoing back on your word. I do not want anybody except Rama\". So \\nsaying, he decided to walk out of the court. At  this juncture, \\nVashishta pacified him and told Dasharatha. “Do  not hesitate to  send \\nRama.

Send  Rama with him.\"   \\n \\nWithout any more hesitation, king Dasharatha blessed R ama and \\nalso Lakshmana who wanted to be with his brother and sent them \\nwith Vishwamitra.  \\n \\nVishwamitra and the two princes travelling barefoot  first crossed the \\nriver Sarayu and then, the river Ganga. Rama and Lakshmana did not \\nmind the hardship at all, as this was their chance to learn about \\nmany things from Vis hwamitra. After many days of walking, they \\nentered a thick forest where a rakshasi called Taraka lived. She had \\nterrorized  all the sages in the forest and hence Vishwamitra \\ninstructed Rama to kill he r. \\n \\nRama drew out  his arrow and aimed it at Taraka. The ugly looking \\ndemoness charged towards him but was killed by Rama\\'s arrow. \\nVishwamitra was very pleased with Rama and gifted him many \\npowerful weapons. Rama accepted them  gracefully and  learnt from \\nVishwamitra about their use.  \\n \\nThe trio continued their journey and reached the spot where \\nVishwamitra was to perform the yagna. The Rishis  of the Ashram \\nwere happy to have Rama in their midst. The princess rested for the \\nnight and from the next morning protec ted the yagna against the \\nRakshasas. Everything went on smoothly till the last day.  \\n \\nOn the  last day of the yagna, suddenly, piece  of flesh and blood fell \\ninto the sacred fire. When Rama looked up, he saw Mareecha  and \\nSubahu. The weapons were so strong and  powerful that Mareecha \\nwas thrown into the sea hundreds of miles away while Subahu was \\nengulfed in a ball of fire. All the Rishis were  relieved that these evil \\ndemons  were destroyed by Rama and joyously completed the Yagna.  \\nAfter conducting the yagna, Vis hwamitra and the other Rishis left for \\nthe city of Maithili . Rama and Lakshmana accompanied them.  \\nThis city was ruled by Janaka, loved and respected for his goodness. \\nHe had a daughter by name Sita. Janaka  had found her in a ploughed \\nfield and had reared h er as his own daughter. Sita  was the loveliest  \\nprincess and was also renowned for her strength  of character. When \\nshe was of the marriageable  age, Janaka had announced  that \\nwhoever  could str ing the Siva bow would wed her. This bow was not \\nan ordinary  bow.

Sage Vishwamitra knew about this bow and had \\npurposely  taken the young princes to Mithila.  \\n \\nOn their way to Mithila, they halted at an Ashram where Gautama , a \\nsage, had once lived. Gauta ma had a wife called Ahalya who was \\nextremely  beautiful.  Indra, the king of the heavens, desired her and \\nin Gautama\\'s absence, made love to her. The enraged Gautama cast \\na curse on Indra. He also cursed Ahalya \"As you have  cheated me, \\nmay you turn into a s tone. You will be rid of this curse only when Sri \\nRama touches you\" so saying, Gautama had gone away to the \\nHimalayas to observe penance.  \\n \\nVishwamitra narrated Ahalya’s tragic  story to Rama and instructed  \\nhim \"Ramachandra! Rescue Ahalya from this curse and  give her a \\nnew life.\"  \\n \\nRama followed this advice and as soon as he touched the stone \\nstatue, Ahalya came to life. At that moment Gautama also returned \\nto the ashram. Gautama  and Ahalya were re -united thus.  \\n \\n1.3 SITA\\'S SWAYAMVAR  \\n \\nVishwamitra, Rama and Lakshmana reached Mithila in time for Sita\\'s \\nswamyamvar: As per Janaka\\'s wish, the  mighty Siva bow was hauled \\nto the wedding hall.  The hall wore a grand look and was fille d with \\nmany kings and princes. Ravana, the king of Lanka was also present \\nand was  confident that he could win Sita\\'s hand easily. For , Janaka  \\nhad announced that to win Sita\\'s hand in marriage, any king or \\nprince had  to lift the bow and string it. Many tried, but failed. Even \\nRavana fell down while trying to lift the bow and had hurried ly \\ndisappeared from the hall out of shame. Vishwamitra  turned towards \\nRama and told him gently \"Son1 I am sure you are keen to examine \\nthe bow. Why don\\'t you lift it and see how heavy it is?\"  \\n \\nKing Janaka was quite doubtful whether a young person like Rama  \\nwould be able to achieve where the others had failed. But he felt \\nvery impressed by Rama\\'s noble looks and hence allowed Rama to \\ncontest.  \\n \\nRama bowed before Vishwamitra to seek his blessings and walked \\nup to the mighty Siva bow.  He lifted it up effortless ly and stringed it. \\nThe entire hall echoed with the sound of bow being stringed. Except ', metadata={'source': 'ramayana_nlp.pdf', 'page': 5}),\n",

King \\nJanaka was extremely happy that Ram a, the eldest prince  of \\nAyodhya was to wed his daughter Sita.   \\n \\nOn Vishwamitra  advice, Janaka sent messengers to Ayodhya to \\nconvey this happy news to Dasharatha.  Rama, Lakshmana and Rishi \\nVishwamitra are now in Mithila after successfully completing yagna.  \\nSri Rama has gained the hand of my daughter Sita in marriage by \\nlifting the Siva bow. I  am therefore inviting you and your family to \\ncome to Mithila and accept Sita as your daughter -in-law\" was the \\nmessage  sent by Janaka.  \\n \\nKing Dasharatha was delighted to hear this news and reached \\nMithila along with his wives, his  ministers, Sage Vashishta and  \\nothers to take part in the wedding.  \\n \\nWhile Rama wed Sita , Uremia  was married to Lakshmana and \\nJanaka\\'s nieces Mondovi  and Shruakirthi to Bharata and Shatrugna . \\n \\nThes e weddings were performed on a very grand scale. Dasharatha \\ndonated cows in the name of each of his sons and not to be outdone;  \\nKling Janaka made cash presents to all the Brahmins. A grand  feast \\nhad been arranged for all the citizens. The newly wed couples  were \\nblessed by one and all.  \\n \\nSita was a devout wife who always stood by her husband. The \\nextremely beautiful  Sita made an ideal couple.  \\n \\nThe day after wedding , Vishwamitra  returned to his Ashram \\n(hermitage). Dasahratha  with his sons and daughters -in-law, along  \\nwith his entourage left for Ayodhya. Half -way through their journey, \\na severe storm broke out. The entire atmosphere was filled with dust \\nand was enveloped in darkness. At  that time, a Rishi by name \\nParushurama appeared before them. His face was ful l of rage. He \\nalso had an enormous bow with him. His awesome  appearance  \\nproclaimed that he was no ordinary rishi. He was the mighty \\nParushurama who had conquered  several Kshatriyas and had \\nvoyaged round the earth twenty -one times.  \\n \\nParushurama went straigh t to Rama, and said in a sarcastic voice \\n\"Rama, I heard that breaking the Siva bow was a very easy for you. \\nI have a bigger and mightier bow.

My  \\nchildren have not done any harm to you. Bless them. Spare  Rama\". \\nParushurama ignored Dasharatha’s  plea. >He taunted Rama again \\nand again.  \\n \\nSmiling gently at this, Rama picked up the bow very easily and fixed \\nthe arrow  to it. He then asked Parushurama \"Sir, you are a Brahmin  \\nand it would be improper for me to use the arrow on you. Hence  \\nplease tell me, at what do I aim the arrow at\".  \\n \\nParushurama was stunned with Rama s’s mastery over the weapon. \\nHe could not even say an ything. He gazed at Rama. It dawned upon \\nhim that Rama was no ordinary person. He bowed his head and \\nsaid\"Rama, I am no match for you. Hence  this mighty bow belongs \\nto you\". He then departed for the Himalayas to continue his penance.  \\n \\nKing Dasharatha  felt relieved;  he then continued his journey towards \\nAyodhya . \\n \\nAt Ayodhya, a grand reception awaited the newlyweds , for many \\ndays, this happy event was celebrated with pomp and pageantry. \\nDasharatha was very happy that his sons, especially Rama, were \\nloved so m uch by the citizens of Ayodhya.  \\n \\n1.4 KAIKEYI AND HER WISHES  \\n \\nSoon after Rama\\'s marriage with Sita, king Dasharatha wanted to \\ncrown him the king as himself was getting older. Dasharatha \\ntherefore consulted his ministers about this. All of them \\nwholeheartedly welcomed this decision. Dasharatha felt very happy \\nand enth usiastic. He looked forwarded to the coronation of Rama. He \\ntherefore immediately made announcements  to this effect. He \\ninvited all the important people of Ayodhya and told them \"I have \\ndecided to crown my eldest son Rama. This is my ardent desire. If all \\nof you agree .I will go ahead with the arrangements.\" Everybody  \\nwas delighted. The people of Ayodhya rejoiced that Rama was to be \\ntheir king.  \\n \\nHectic preparations were on.

Even \\nwhile these preparations were going on. Dasahratha  had a talk with \\nRama and advised him about how king should conduct himself. \"A \\nking should never fall a prey to vices: He should treat each and every \\none with respect and rule the kingdom well\" was Dasharatha\\'s \\nadvice to Rama. He also talked to his son about the duties of a king.  \\n \\nKaushalya was very happy to hear that Rama was to be crowned \\nshortly. She generou sly gifted valuable jewelry  to those who \\nconveyed this good news to her.  \\n \\nAt the time of proclaiming that Rama was to be crowned , Bharatha  \\nand Shatrugna  were away from Ayodhya. Sumitra, Shatrugna  \\nmother was also happy to hear the news.  \\n  \\nWhen this news r eached Kaikeyi, she was delighted that Rama was \\nto be the king, but soon, Manthara, her maid poisoned her mind.  \\n“Kaika , have  you forgotten that you also have a son? Your son \\nBharata  has equal rights over this kingdom. If Rama becomes  the \\nking, then Kaushalaya’s haughtiness will  know no bounds. You will \\nbe her maid and Bharata  will be treated like Rama’s servant. You are \\nsupposed to be king Dasharatha’s  favourite.But how has he proved \\nit? By making Rama the king and ignoring Bharata  totally? Is it fair? \\n“Just think about the future.”  \\n“Why should I think about the future?” replied Kaikeyi. “Manthara, \\nRama is the eldest born. He is virtuous; he is valiant and is \\nthoroughly well -versed in all sciences and all arts. People love him. \\nSo do me. Because I lov e him more than my own son.  \\nManthara would  not give up. Speaking in loving tone, she told \\nKaikeyi “Dear child! I am old enough to know the ways of the world. \\nI can only pity you for your misplaced love towards Rama. Just \\nimagine! What will be the fate of Bharata ! And look at your husband \\n.He has taken this decision at a time when Bharatha and Shatrugna \\naway  from Ayodhya.

       " Document(page_content='9 \\n Provoked by Manthara, Kaikeyi thought  about what she said. No, she \\ndid not mind Rama being the king. But  could she, the favorite  wife of \\nDasahratha , be a slave to Kaushalya? “Never” decided Kaikeyi mind . \\nSo she immediately asked Manthara “ I agree with you. But how do  \\nwe prevent Rama from becoming the king?” “Simple” answered \\nManthara, “Send  him to the forest.”  \\n“But how?” \\n“Don’t you remember that Dasharatha had agreed to grant you two \\nwishes when you saved him in the war against devas and As uras?  \\nAsk them now.  Dasahratha  will come to your chambers   \\nTo talk about  Rama’s coronation. Show him that you are angry.  \\nAnd demand your  two wishes. First of all, demand that Bharatha \\nshould  be crowned the  king. Your second  wish should  be to banish \\nRama to the forest for 14 years”  \\nKaikeyi was totally  changed. She forgot about Rama’s love for  her or \\nthat she had looked  upon him as her own son. At  that moment , \\nRama  appeared to be her enemy, someone who was usurping \\nBharatha  of the kingdom . Filled with hatred and anger, she tore up \\nall the fine clothes she had worn, she pulled out the jewelry  and \\nthrew them on the floor. And she sat huddled in the corner.  \\nThe old king came to Kaikeyi  chamber to share his happiness, to  tell \\nher about the gr and preparations for the coronation. But  he was \\nupset when  he saw the strewn jewelry and  the torn clothes. And \\nwhen he saw his dear queen in tears he was puzzled. He gently \\nwiped her tears and asked her “o, my precious one! Why are you \\nangry? I love you  very dearly. Tell me. Why are you so upset?”  \\nKaikeyi grabbed  this opportunity . “Will  you grant me  the two wishes \\ndue to me long ago?” she asked.  \\nHave no doubt, dear” said the king. “ I swear  on Rama that I will \\nkeep up my word.”  \\nFeeling  bold, Kaikeyi  demanded ‘’  my first wish  is that Bharatha \\nshould  be crowned the king. To fulfill  my second wish, Rama should ', metadata={'source': 'ramayana_nlp.pdf', 'page': 9}),\n",

Otherwise,  I will end my life.”  \\nKing Dasharatha could not believe  his own ears. He was horrified \\nthat Kaikeyi could be so mean and ruthless. “Are you playing a joke \\non me “he asked her? \\n“No, I am very serious”, Kaikeyi said, laughing crudely . \\nThe king was shocked. He fainted. After a while, he regained his \\nconsciou sness and pleaded with her “Kaika, give up your wishes. \\nWhat you ask for is totally unfair. You have always told me that you \\nlove Rama as your son. Bharatha has been very devoted to Rama \\nand when he comes to know of your treachery, he will never forgive \\nyou. Don’t Kaika, don’t! Give up such dangerous thoughts. I cannot \\nbear to be separated from Rama. Don’t inflict  this agony upon me in \\nmy old age. If you insist,  I will crown Bharatha  as the king but  \\nplease do not banish my Rama to the forest”. King Dasahrat ha just  \\ncould not control his  emotions and  wept bitterly.  \\nKaikeyi was  unmoved. She did not want Rama in Ayodhya because \\nshe felt that only then Bharatha would be able to gain the love and \\nrespect of the people of Ayodhya. So she was adamant. “Keep up \\nyour word” she insisted. The king went pale anxiety . Rama was born \\nas a result of yagna and that too, after being childless for a very long \\ntime. How could Dasahratha  betray such a precious son?  Why was \\nKaikeyi behaving in such a wicked manner? Who provoked her  into \\nthis?  \\nTormented with these thoughts, the  king again tries  to change \\nKaikeyi  mind “Kaika, are you angry that I decided on Rama’s \\ncoronation without telling  you? If  so, please forgive  me. I beg of \\nyou. Agree to this coronation  .People will  love and res pect you for \\nthis. \\nKaikeyi did not budge.Dashratha spent that night in Kaikeyi  \\nchamber, pleading  with her, begging  her and crying for mercy. The \\nmorning dawned. The  city of Ayodhya wore a gay look. People  were \\ngetting ready to take part in the coronation ceremony. Vashishta  and \\nother sages were busy with rituals.

Kaikeyi  stopped him from talking to the \\nking and ordered him “ Sumatra, go and fetch Rama here.  I want  to \\ntalk to him.”  \\nSumnathara conveyed this message to Rama and Rama reached \\nKaikeyi’s  chamber immediately. On  seeing him, the  old king just \\ncould not control his tears and cried out “Rama! My dearest son \\nRama!”  \\n“Mother , why is father looking so pale and grief -stricken ? Have I \\ncaused him any anguish?” asked Rama politely.  \\nKaikeyi told him about her two wishes and about the king’s \\nreluctance to agree to them.  \\nWithout any hesitation Rama at once agreed to carry out her wishe s \\n“Mother, you want me to live in the forest like a hermit. Is  that all? I \\nwill do anything for you. I will leave to -day itself. Bharatha  is my \\nbrother. I will be happiest person to see him as the king.

Please console him and please summon Bharatha to \\nAyodhya at once.”  \\nKaikeyi was delighted that Rama had agreed to carry out her wishes. \\n“Rama, I will  send  word to Bharatha.

He touched his parent’s feet \\nin salutation and left the chamber in a very dignified manner.  \\nKaush alya on hearing the news lamented “Rama, my child!  How can \\nI live without you?

Should  a prince like \\nRama live in a forest eating simple food and sleeping on a r ough –\\nstraw mat? But Rama would not hear of any such argument and so, \\nwith a heavy heart, she  bid farewell to her dearest son.  \\nAfter taking leave of his mother, Rama went to talk to Sita. As  soon \\nas she heard that Bharatha  was to be the king and that Rama was to \\nlive in the forest,  she decided to go with her husband. Rama tried to \\nprevent her by saying “Janaki, don’t worry about me.  Please stay \\nback in the palace and take care of my mothers. Treat my brothers \\nwell. At  the end of the fourteen year of period,  I will  return safely to \\nAyodhya. No harm will come to me”.  \\nSita replied “ Lord,  I will follow you like a shadow. I do not want the \\ncomforts of  the palace without you. Nothing can give me greater \\nhappiness than being  with you”. Rama tried his utmost to dissuade \\nher “Wild  beasts roam around in the f orest. You will not have a soft \\nbed to sleep on. Nor will there be good food to eat. Your tender feet \\nwill hurt when you walk on the thorny paths”.   \\nSita did not lose courage “Aryaputra,  How can the beasts attack m e \\nwhen you are there? Without you, even the softest bed will be like a \\nbed of thorns. It  is my duty to be with you. Please let me come with \\nyou” pleaded Sita softly. So  Rama agreed to Sita’s request.  \\nLakshmana,  who heard about Rama and Sita’s decision, cam e \\nrunning to him, fell at his brother’s feet and begged of him “Please  \\ndo not leave me behind. I will  also come with you to the forest;  \\nAyodhya will be like hell to me without you.” Rama hesitated, for, \\nthere was a very strong bond of love  and affection be tween the two \\nof them. But at the same time, why should Lakshmana undergo such  \\nexile for the sake of brotherly love, thought  of Rama. So he said, \\n“Sowmitri , if you come away with me, who will protect and look \\nafter our parents?

He swore “I will kill Ravana who has \\nseparated  Sita from me”.  \\nSugriva consoled his friend Rama  and promised him that he would \\nsend the Vanara  army to trace Sita and they help in killing Ravana. \\nIn return, the grateful Rama offered to kill Vali and help Sugriva in \\nregaining  his kingdom.  \\nSugriva  who was still not aware  of Rama’s enormous  skill and \\nbravery was doubtful whether he could  fight against  the very \\npowerful Vali.  \\n“Dear friend”  he told Rama “I  am glad with your  offer to kill Vali.

So  I am \\njustified in killing  you in a surprise attack.”  \\nVali could not say anything against this argument. So, he took \\nSugriva’s hand  in his own and asked  him to look after his own son \\nangada well. In a few moments Vali was dead.  \\nSugriva,  who regained the kingdom of Kishkinda, soon forgot all \\nabout helping Rama to trace Sita.

Not \\neven Kumbakarna or you. So, act  sensibly and send back Sita.  \\nRavana, his son Indrajit  and the Rakshasas thought that Vibhishana  \\nwas behaving like a coward. Vibhisana’s frank talk was not liked by  \\nanyone. When he once again suggested that  Ravana should avoid \\nwar with Rama, Ravana was very angry.  \\nVibhishana , are you really my brother? You talk  as if I am your \\nenemy. I  have spared you because I still have some affection for \\nyou. Otherwise I would have killed you this very moment. Don’t ever \\nstep into Lanka again. Get out from here”.  \\nFeeling sad that  his brother ignored his advice, Vibhishana , with four \\nof his followers,  went to Rama and sought refuge under him.  \\n“Sri” Vibhishana  introduced himself to Rama, “I am Vibhishana , \\nRavenna’s  brother. I have come to seek refuge under you. I tried my \\nlevel best to make Ravana realize his mistake. I told him to hand \\nover Sita and make peace with you. He ridiculed me and drove me \\nout of Lanka. Rama, please accept me as your humble servant.”  \\nSugriva and the other Vanara leaders did not like this request, so \\nthey told Rama “Rama, Vibhishana  belongs to  the enemy camp . \\nMoreover he is a Rakshasa and a trickster. So, please think about \\nthis before you come to any decision. Hunumanth then remembered  \\nhow Vibhishana  had sided him in Ravenna’s  court. So, he told Rama \\n“Rama, Vibhishana  has probably  approached  you as he can be come \\nthe king of Lanka after Ravenna’s  death.
